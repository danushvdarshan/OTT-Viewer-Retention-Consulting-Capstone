📌 OTT Viewer Retention – Consulting Capstone (IIT Guwahati)

-----> Project Context:
      OTT platforms observe strong initial attraction to new series, yet a 
      significant share of viewers disengage during or immediately after Season 1.
      This early drop-off directly impacts:
          . Long-term customer value
          . Content investment decisions
          . Platform growth efficiency
      This project was completed as part of the Winter Consulting Capstone Program 
      by the Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati, where it received an 
      Excellence Certificate (Top 10%).

-----> Objective:
      Using episode-level OTT engagement data, the project aimed to:
      Identify key drivers of viewer continuation
      Segment episodes based on design and viewer behavior
      Recommend practical, implementable actions to reduce early drop-off
      
-----> Hypothesis:
      Viewer disengagement is strongly influenced by episode-level design choices,         particularly:
            Pacing and narrative flow
            Cognitive load and attention effort
            Strength of early hooks
            
-----> Analytical Approach:
      Exploratory analysis of episode-level engagement metrics
      Behavioral signals such as pauses, rewinds, and watch completion
      Segmentation combining content design and viewer behavior
      Interpretation of findings in a product and business context
      
-----> Key Insights:
      1. Faster pacing consistently reduces drop-off
            Drop-off probability declines almost linearly as pacing increases
            High-pacing episodes show ~20% lower drop-off than slow-paced ones
            This pattern holds across both early and later episodes
      2. High cognitive load amplifies disengagement
            Higher pauses and rewinds
            Lower average watch percentage
            Strongest negative impact when combined with slow pacing
      3. Hooks help, but are not sufficient alone
            Strong hooks improve retention
            Most effective when paired with fast pacing and low cognitive load
            
-----> Episode Segmentation:
      Episodes were segmented using pacing, cognitive load, and hook strength:
      Fast & Accessible: High pacing, low cognitive load → Lowest drop-off (~39%)
      Fast but Complex: High pacing, high cognitive load → Moderate drop-off (~52%)
      Slow & Dense: Low pacing, high cognitive load → Highest drop-off (~58%)
      
-----> Core Insight:
      Viewer disengagement is driven by how demanding and slow an episode feels, not       simply by season length or episode count.
      
-----> Recommendations:
    . Episode-Level Interventions:
          Increase pacing by shortening slow sequences and maintaining narrative               momentum
          Manage cognitive load using visual/contextual cues and recap segments
          Introduce strong hooks strategically, especially for slow & dense episodes
          Apply differentiated actions by episode archetype
    . Product-Level Interventions:
          Provide viewer guidance or pacing indicators
          Monitor drop-off trends by episode archetype using analytics dashboards
          All actions were prioritized based on impact vs feasibility.
          
-----> Risks & Mitigation:
        Risk      : Over-simplifying content may hurt creative quality
        Mitigation: Apply selectively to critical episodes and validate via viewer                       testing
        Risk      : Misalignment with genre expectations
        Mitigation: Customize pacing and hooks based on genre norms
        Risk      : Viewer fatigue from excessive cues
        Mitigation: Balance interventions with narrative flow
